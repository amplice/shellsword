## DRAMATIC PLAY-BY-PLAY

**The Opening Gambit**
The strip crackled with tension as both fencers began their deadly dance at distance 4. Both Nox and the Bot advance simultaneously, steel singing through the air as they closed to the critical distance 2 - the heart of tactical warfare. The crowd held its breath as both fencers hesitated, each raising their parries in perfect synchronization, resulting in two wasted moves as neither dared to commit to the attack.

**The First Blood** 
With nerves steadying, both warriors pressed forward once more, advancing into the clash zone at distance 1 where every move could be fatal. In a moment of pure instinct and aggression, both fencers exploded into simultaneous lunges - steel met steel in a spectacular DOUBLE HIT! The scoreboards flashed 1-1 as both fighters drew first blood, neither giving ground in this battle of wills.

**The Turning Point**
The Bot, perhaps drunk on the taste of blood, committed to another aggressive lunge. But Nox had read the pattern perfectly - a masterful parry deflected the incoming steel and transformed into a lightning RIPOSTE that found its mark! The crowd erupted as Nox took the lead 2-1, the distance resetting as both fighters prepared for the next engagement.

**The Final Fury**
Closing once again from distance 4, both fencers advanced with grim determination, knowing victory hung by a thread. Nox pressed the psychological advantage, advancing while the Bot wasted a desperate parry, creating the perfect setup at distance 1. With match point on the line, both warriors made their final choice - twin lunges in a glorious explosion of steel and determination. The final DOUBLE HIT rang across the strip like a thunderclap, but it was Nox who claimed victory at 3-2, having reached the sacred three touches first!
